IO is the interface for read and write.

It is implemented as a p9, direct file, or direct memory write.

So we need to connect reg to IO and we should be there.

see t9/reg.go: that part is done.

This needs /dev/reg32, and that is implemented as well.

So for LED, what remains, is to read and write the reg32, and set the bit.
